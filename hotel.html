        <p id="ram">TIRUVANANTAPURAM <br><br>
            The name Thiruvananthapuram which means ‘the city of Lord Ananta’ is an indication of the temple’s deep connection with the city. The temple is a mix of Keralite and Tamil temple architecture. The foundation of the present gopuram of the temple was laid in the year 1566 CE even though the temple history predates many centuries.
